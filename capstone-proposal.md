## Project Proposal

* * * * *

**Name of Student:**   
Mike Wilkes

**Name of Project:**   
Podcast Translator

**Project's Purpose or Goal:**   
Allow users to direct the app to a podcast episode, then recieve the same episode translated to the language of their choice.

**List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:**

- A web app with a form submission that allows users to select an audio file and select a language pair, submit, and recieve a text transcription downloaded in their chosen language.

**What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to *your* track, and *your* language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**

- Javascript and React 
- APIs for audio transcription and text translation
- Until I understand this week's material better I can't say whether I would use   NoSQL/Firebase/Firestore

**If you finish developing the [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react/react-fundamentals/capstone-planning-the-minimum-viable-product) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**

Features I would like to explore:
- Additional ways of gathering source file, such as: Paste a url, RSS feed, search, view and select from global podcast charts.
- Transcription only option (no translation)
- Audio-to-audio translation
- Audio-to-audio translation, generated with the original speaker's voice (I know this technology exists but don't know if it is avalable as a service/API call)
- Recieve an email with a download link
- A pleasing design/interface

**What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**

- APIs for podcast discovery, podcast charts, voice generation.
- To enable a download link:
    - Hosting for user-generated text and audio
    - Email address or service to generate and send links

**Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?**
